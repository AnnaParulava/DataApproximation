<p>My part was to develop a program that could find the shortest backbone using the Prim's algorithm. In addition, I developed Terms of reference. Also, Anastasia and I, using special tools, made an organizational and navigation part for the communication of the project participants</p>

<h4>Nikitina Sofya</h4>

<p>My part was to develop a program that could find the spanning tree of a given graph using the "in depth" search algorithm. Alina and I were working on an algorithm for entering data in the form of a table.</p>

<h4>Parulava Anna</h4>
